These changes are affordable, simple to adopt, and help create a greener home with less effort than you'd expect."

Start with a small bin — even a bucket will do. Mix 'greens' (like veggie peels, fruit scraps, coffee grounds) and 'browns' (like dried leaves, cardboard, paper) to create the right balance. Turn your compost occasionally and keep it moist. In a few weeks to months, you’ll have healthy, earthy-smelling compost perfect for houseplants, gardens, or community green spaces. It's a great way to reduce kitchen waste and reconnect with nature."
